This is the next js project. It is a blog post project where users can view different blogs based on their category. 
For users who have signed up, they get access to the following:
* Create a post.
* View own posts.(Search signle post or view all posts).
* Edit a post
* Delete the post.

The project uses cloudinary for uploading the images, mysql as backend, next js as frontend.
It also uses prisma as an ORM that makes it easy for Node.js + typescript(in next js for this case) to work with database.
